## Notes
- This file is intentionally GitHub-friendly (no <style> blocks) and keeps animations via GIFs so GitHub/VSCode will render them correctly.
- If you want a PDF export, a printable layout, or a version with your own photo/GIF, tell me the image URL or upload the image and I‚Äôll produce it.
